            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>When it comes to coding, I'm not exactly an expert on every tool, language, and platform. But I have seen how widespread, versitile, and essential JavaScript has become. I am excited to master it through time and effort, and see the a good chunk of the inner guts of what makes so much of the web tick. I also have another perspective I bring to the deal: I've been on the operations side, where I've seen both glossy, well coded sites that get customers excited, and some subpar efforts that have blown up into a backdraft of user complaints. I can put myself in the shoes of the poor souls grinding away to make a buisiness run, and give them that much more help than the next guy.</p>
